# Machine_Learning_Tools_And_Basics
## Things I learn from this repository.
### 1.Handle csv file by pandas, numpy and matplotlib libaries
(1)Learn data cleaning and some training tips such as one hot encoding, pretrained weights and handling imbalanced datasets, data augmentation by numpy ,pandas and keras.

(2)Learn data visualization by matplotlib.
### 2.Machine Learning Algorithms by Tensorflow API

(1)I learn to use machine learning algorithms api by tensorflow such as KNN, SVM, and Random Forest.

### 3.Implement algorithms, activation functions and loss function from scratch
(1)Implement loss function such as MAE, MSE, and LogLoss from scratch.

(2)Implement gradient descent algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent, batch gradient descent and mini batch gradient descent from scratch.

(3)Implement activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh, relu and leaky relu from scratch.
